# Kodit
Kodit contains programming problems and solutions that I solve at least a a problem per day. especially, I would firstly write in C++, then If I have more time and the problem is interesting solution, I may add other languages as well. This is a part of my learning and I hoep we could learn together.
### Where questions are form?
I search interesting questions from everywhere, mostly from Internet or even a textbook. 
### Just do anything with it
Just do anything with it. You can learn or suggest me a better solution. Feel free to commit.

> Feel free to criticize any line of code, I would love to learn from it.

### Suggestions
if you are going to copy these for homework or whatever, please at least understand at least a line of codes what it does.
