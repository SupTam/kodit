# Kodit
Kodit contains programming problems and solutions that I solve at least a problem per day. Mainly, I would first write in C++, and then If I have more time and the problem is an attractive solution, I may add other languages as well. Kodit is a part of my learning, and I hope we could learn together.
### Where from questions are?
I search for interesting questions from everywhere, mostly from the Internet or even a textbook. 
### do anything with it
Just do anything with it. You can learn or suggest me a better solution. Feel free to commit.

> Feel free to criticize any line of code, I would love to learn from it.

### Suggestions
if you are going to copy these for homework or whatever, please at least understand at least a line of codes what it does.
